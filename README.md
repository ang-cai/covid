Analyzing COVID covariate vector data in NYC boroughs using confirmatory factor analysis at Telethon Kids Institute

The work will require the intern to become familiar with the analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys datasets and geographical (raster & vector) datasets, as well as to study and apply a confirmatory factor analysis algorithm."
